        <p class="para">This module was perhaps the most enjoyable so far. 
            An excellent blend of coding and designing. Although I have some 
            experience as a graphic designer from a part time job I had since 
            high school, and I had designed websites before using 
            builders (no coding involved), but I never made designs from scratch 
            for the company I worked for because they usually use ready made templates. I 
            also did not have much of spare time as a high school student. 
            Therefore, having to create a website and posters from scratch was 
            such a delightful project to make, and has sharpened my skills in 
            graphic designing. It has helped me acquire some beginner-level 
            skills in coding world as well. 
        </p>

            To be honest, I have always been an improviser since I could remember. 
            Planning essays, projects, plays, designs, and even initialising ideas 
            was not my best flex. I usually struggle to come up with a plan. 
            That depends on the description and limitations of the task. I end up 
            having a storm of ideas and concepts that I want to try, but time is 
            such an expensive thing, and I’m a student on budget. However, once 
            my mind settles on one, the rest of it seems to flow spontaneously. 
            Making this website was no different, I just let it flow. As poetic 
            as this sounds, it comes with some tough troubles. The major one I 
            would say is changing and trying many new ideas, which is a big 
            confusion and time absorbing. Not to mention that, due to COVID 
            travel restriction, I arrived late and had to sell some of my already 
            skinny time to catch up with the class.

        <div style="margin-bottom: 50px;"></div>

        <p class="para">
            I had a few challenges coding and styling the website. I wanted to 
            include more dynamic on it (using JavaScript) but neither time nor 
            my humble skills seemed to match the idea. So, I decided to play it safe 
            for this term. I also struggled at the beginning to put the website 
            together and design it code wise. However, revising the worksheets and looking 
            through online tutorials had helped me make it see the light. Making 
            the website responsive was I believe the final boss on this journey. 
            I had to try many methods until I, somehow, managed to make it viewable 
            across devices. It is nothing fancy, and I had to compromise on the 
            visual appealingness of the website a lot, but it will do for now. I had 
            intended to make my own animated header background using JavaScript 
            and tutorials from Intro to Creative Coding module, but again… time.

            Overall, it was a fruitful project and will help me for this module, 
            other modules and for the future. I am looking forward to having 
            more challenges like this, if not harder, in the upcoming term.

        <h5> I would like to shout my gratitude to Yazzed for 
            helping me sort an issue with my GitHub that caused an unwanted 
            stress to me, and for being very usefull to other classmates during this journey.
            He deserves some credits, coffee and chocolate for that :D
